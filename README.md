# wedding-terminal

This is a small website that behaves like an Ubuntu terminal emulator. I sent the address to the 3 friends I wanted as my best men so they could play with it and the made-up commands.

They all live in a different country and I used that at my advantage. By executing the `wedding groomsmen` command, the terminal detected their IP and could guess who was using the website. The terminal then added a more personal touch by addressing them by their first name and asking them to become a witness.

You can try it for yourself [here](http://terminal.borson.fr)
